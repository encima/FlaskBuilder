FlaskBuilder
============

A small website, running with flask.py, that allows simple creation of websites.

Built for a friend that does not have much knowledge of HTML, but applicable to all. Sites are stored in MongoDB 
and user details (for now) are stored in plain text in sqlite.

This is an early build, but it is in use right now, so I thought I would share.

Comments etc are more than welcome, I am very new to flask!
